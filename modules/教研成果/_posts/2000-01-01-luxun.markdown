# 鲁迅不仅是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和革命家。

    “鲁迅专题研究”是一门研究鲁迅生平、思想和创作的作家研究科目。鲁迅是现代中国文化革命的主将，他的文学活动和著作涉及面极广，涵盖了哲学、伦理学、美学文学等多学科领域，对中华民族新文化和现代文学发展作出了巨大贡献，留下了十分丰富的思想文化遗产。学习鲁迅创作，继承鲁迅精神，创造民族新文化，具有十分重要的意义。

    《鲁迅专题研究》是高等学校中文系的专业选修课，它是在学习了《中国现代文学史》、《中国现代文学作品选读》等基础课后所设置的一门提高课。由于本课程是专题性的又是综合性的，所以处于现代文学有直接关系外，与文学理论、美学、古代文学、外国文学等都有密切联系。

    本课程内容包括鲁迅研究历史的介绍、鲁迅小说、杂文、散文诗《野草》等的理论探讨、鲁迅美学思想以及鲁迅与中国古代文学、外国文学的关系的论述。任务是要对鲁迅作综合性的专题学习和探讨，以便于比较系统、比较全面、比较深入地理解鲁迅，即从比较宏观的角度来把握鲁迅的思想、作品和艺术创造活动。希望学生在学习时要善于运用过去学过的所有课程的有关知识，加深对鲁迅的理解，并体会毛泽东同志关于“鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向”的论述。


But open online courses think about content a bit differently. 
Since your learners will be encouraged to find their own resources and interact with others, knowledge emerges organically. Here are a few ways that you can think about developing content in your course: 

![content slide.001.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/content slide/content%20slide.001.jpg)

### Peers co-create the content. 

In the video you looked at in the last module, Jim Groom mentions that content is the "residue" of interactions in the course. What this means is that, when activities are open-ended and creative, the social interactions around them build out much of what we think of as "content" for an open course. 

In another P2PU course, [Rhizomatic Learning](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/882/rhizomatic-learning-the-community-is-the-curriculum/), Dave Cormier asked learners to participate in the design of the course--the community was going to decide what to learn together. After Dave "officially" stopped running the course in week 6, the course continued to evolve without him--proof of success if ever there was any. 

### Use openly-licensed content that already exists.

The Open Education movement and the use of Creative Commons licenses for educational content have given rise to a wealth of open educational resources. If you'd like to pull together a few foundational resources, [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) and the [Saylor Foundation](http://www.saylor.org/) are both great sources for OERs you can use in your course. Don't forget to attribute correctly.

We used openly-licensed content for our "[A Gentle Introduction to Python](http://reports.p2pu.org/mooc-maker/)" course, and grouped learners together around the chapters and tutorials in the main text we used. The interaction happened around the content, and it was super-nifty. 

### Learners can create tutorials for other learners.

Seasoned educators know that when a student teaches another student, their understanding deepens. That's peer learning in a nutshell. You might want to prompt learners to create a ["Teaching Kit"](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/activity-1-create-a-teaching-kit/332) to accompany their project. For our [Mozilla Webmaker course](https://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/), learners created tutorials to help someone else complete the project in the future. 

These teaching kits/tutorials ask learners to reflect on their project and model a ["reflective practice"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice) (mmmmm, tasty self-assessment). At the same time, learners are creating their own OERs to contributione to the wider open learning landscape. 

## Give Your Content a Vibe

As we mentioned earlier in this course, we create playful learning experiences that last. The wittier, chattier and more mysterious the better. We always try to strike a balance between playful language and internationalization (what's funny in Australia might not be in Germany) but concepts that make us laugh are concepts that stick. 

The Open University's P2PU course on ["Open Research"] (https://p2pu.org/he/courses/2377/open-research/) decided to deliver all of their examples through a character named "Mr. O'Pen." 



By setting a playful tone, you are modeling how easy it can be to engage the community and making your little corner of the internet a very welcoming one. 


## Course Length

Let's re-think "length." Because ideally what you are building is an online community--one that is ongoing, self-sustaining, and engaged. And in a community, you're never really "done". When is the last time you were done being a musician? Or a teacher? Or a writer? 

When you look at your community longitudinally, it's natural that folks are going to participate in different ways. Our fellow community-builder [Alex Hillman](http://dangerouslyawesome.com/) subscribes to the 80/20 rule: your community will break down into gradations between somewhat active and most active participants:

*Participation is a continuum of activity, and our data at P2PU bears that out.* When looking at one of our recent P2PU courses, folks reported engaging on a pleathora of ways:

So instead of thinking about beginning and finishing, you might think about the course you are developing as *an onramp to your ongoing community* that lives on P2PU.org or somewhere else. You might run Arduino 101 every 8 weeks, but the Arduino G+ group is always there to help, and that way the expert folks can help newbies. 

Some relevant data as to how to design your onborading: recent research by [Martin Weller](http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/design-responses-to-mooc-completion-rates.html) and [Katy Jordan](http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html) indicate that, no matter what the discipline, there seems to be a 4-week long "sweet spot" in active participation.

So the first 30 days of your course make all the difference. We'd recommend a four-week onboarding course that runs regularly as an introduction to your learning community.
